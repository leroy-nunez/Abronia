# Blue Sparks

I don't feel anything when I prick my finger.
I don't feel anything when the onion fumes sneak up my nose.
I don't feel anything when they call me nasty names.
I only feel anything when I'm with you.

I didn't feel anything when my dog Achilles died.
I didn't feel anything when I saw my house burn down.
I didn't feel anything when that drifter stabbed me in the gut.
I only felt anything when you looked me in the eye.

I didn't hear anything when those sirens came racing down the boulevard.
I didn't hear anything when the shots rang out in the homeroom down the hall.
I didn't hear anything when Carly Rae told me to run away with her on the radio.
I only heard anything when your voice said my name.

I know that I am dead when I go walking down the street.
I know that I am dead when I go to Trader Joe's for groceries.
I know that I am dead when I'm in my office staring at the screen.
But when you walk into the room, I am Lazarus resurrected.
When I hear your voice the color comes back to my face,
and the clouds are cleared from my eyes.
And I see you and my heart pumps blood and I know that I am alive.

When you fell off your scooter and skinned your knee, I bled for you.
When those men catcalled you on your way to Equinox, I fought for you.
When your sister died in that freak snowmobile accident, I cried for you.
When you told me how much you love Mikey from the bookstore, I was so happy for you.

I could give you heaven on Earth, 
love that no language could express,
and you will never give me a second thought.
But all you have to do is shoot me a look,
to be the spark that created life.
