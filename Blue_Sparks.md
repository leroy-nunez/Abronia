# Blue Sparks

I don't feel anything when I prick my finger.<br />
I don't feel anything when the onion fumes sneak up my nose.<br />
I don't feel anything when they call me nasty names.<br />
I only feel anything when I'm with you.<br />

I didn't feel anything when my dog Achilles died.<br />
I didn't feel anything when I saw my house burn down.<br />
I didn't feel anything when that drifter stabbed me in the gut.<br />
I only felt anything when you looked me in the eye.<br />

I didn't hear anything when those sirens came racing down the boulevard.<br />
I didn't hear anything when the shots rang out in the homeroom down the hall.<br />
I didn't hear anything when Carly Rae told me to run away with her on the radio.<br />
I only heard anything when your voice said my name.<br />

I know that I am dead when I go walking down the street.<br />
I know that I am dead when I go to Trader Joe's for groceries.<br />
I know that I am dead when I'm in my office staring at the screen.<br />
But when you walk into the room, I am Lazarus resurrected.<br />
When I hear your voice the color comes back to my face,<br />
and the clouds are cleared from my eyes.<br />
And I see you and my heart pumps blood and I know that I am alive.<br />

When you fell off your scooter and skinned your knee, I bled for you.<br />
When those men catcalled you on your way to Equinox, I fought for you.<br />
When your sister died in that freak snowmobile accident, I cried for you.<br />
When you told me how much you love Mikey from the bookstore, I was so happy for you.<br />

I could give you heaven on Earth,<br />
love that no language could express,<br />
and you will never give me a second thought.<br />
But all you have to do is shoot me a look,<br />
to be the spark that created life.<br />
