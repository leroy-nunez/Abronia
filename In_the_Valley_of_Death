Smoke spews from the mountains.
The sky turns black.
The sky turns red.
The ground melts beneath our feet.
The air turns to fire.
The water turns to acid.
The methane seeps into our lungs.
Bodies float up to the surface.
Bodies crash down to the ground.
But as I scuttle through the garden of bones,
a sapling grows from the ashes before my eyes.
From the Valley of Death, I will rise.

The sky above plummets atop us.
The air turns to ice.
The water turns to soap.
Giants fall all around me.
Plants burst into flames.
The ground suffocates,
across a grey, new world.
But from the carnage, opportunity arises.
I set my sights up above.
From my underground bunker,
I reach for the sky.
From the Valley of Death, I will fly.

Vomit spews from my mouth.
Rum comes in one end.
Rum comes out the other end.
Rum numbs the pain,
as new faces swirl around me.
But try as I might, I can not forget,
The empty depression next to me on the bed.
So I wander around this hurricane,
Searching for fellow ghosts, 
to help me carry the strain.
And I repeat this refrain.
In the Valley of Death, I will love again.

Horns blare from the streets.
Drums thunder down the avenue,
marching along a syncopated beat.
Coffins parade through the thoroughfare,
strangers join the procession,
singing a song they have never heard,
a song that has always existed,
since before our gills turned to ears,
before our fins turned to feet.
Before the body in the box
heard the song, entranced.
In the Valley of Death, we will dance.

Muscles atrophy along my limbs.
Bedsheets burn through my skin.
Air wheezes through shrunken lungs.
Blood races through clogged veins.
One by one, the machinery breaks down.
I fall asleep with mushrooms in my eyes.
I wake up with egg yolk on my tongue.
The sand flows through my flippers,
the light of the moon guides me
to my treacherous ocean home.
Where my life, I will give.
In the Valley of Death, I will live.
