When I die do not bury me
Do not burn, quarter, or crucify me
Take my skin, my heart, lungs, and liver
Pump them with formal, stretch them to leather
Take my eyes and put them in jars
Take my brain and put it behind bars
Put my bones in immaculately labelled boxes
Along with the bears, whales, and foxes
Then, one day, millions of years from now
An outside visitor will come upon these dusty cabinets
They'll open the box where my swollen clavicle resides
And they will know what a human being really is
