Victor Valerio was abducted by aliens,
as he was sleeping on a bench at Marcus Garvey Park.
He was ensconsed in a subtle neon green glow,
floated up to their starship.
They gave him a hot shower,
a clean shave and a Caesar cut.
They clothed him in bespoke garments,
made of linen, shimmering emerald to match his eyes.
They placed him in a new pair of orthopedic sneakers,
neon red to match his shock of hair.

They fed him a full three course meal,
Bruschetta appetizer made with fresh mozzarella,
gnocchi with sausage, shrimp, shaved parmesan,
served in a creamy vodka sauce,
just as Mam√° used to make it, 
paired with a light pilsner brewed in Prague.
and for dessert, a rich tiramisu,
so soft you didn't know where the cream ends and the savoiardi begins.

They then took him to a room,
the room was a screen,
a screen that showed him the minutes of his life,
from St. Luke's Hospital,
to a ground floor apartment in Alphabet City,
to a playground where he broke Alex's nose,
to a High School Prom where Alex broke his heart,
to a Dorm at Fordham where he tried his first drop of acid,
to a job at Duane Reade headquarters,
to a mass layoff at Duane Reade headquarters,
to a late unemployment application,
to an eviction notice,
to all the vagaries of life that would turn a park bench into a home.

But he is with the aliens now.
Where they will take him to fantastical worlds,
the turbulent red storms of Jupiter,
the calming yellow oceans of Titan,
the Blue Flares of Betelgeuse,
the pulsar winds of the Crab Nebula,
to the end of the Universe,
where he will see himself in another world,
where he has a clean shave and a Caesar cut.
And then he will go to sleep,
in a Goldilocks mattress,
and sheets of linen.

Victor Valerio was not abducted by aliens.
He never saw the pulsar winds of the Crab Nebula.
He was taken into a wagon by the Boys in Blue.
To an undisclosed location,
simply for sleeping.
He was just a man.
A Wandering albatross whose signals got crossed.
