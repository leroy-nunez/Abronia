This nest has grown too small for me
This town has grown too simple to me
And I have grown old enough to start this life
So while Ma and Pa say goodbye in tears
I'll spread my wings aloft
And I'll fly away

I'll live in this box with fellow goblins
Subsisting on pizza, vodka, and adderall
Reading Popper, Nietzche, and Pearson
And after four years of debauchery
They'll give me this paper that says Bachelor's of Science
That will get me this here job
And I'll fly away

Now all the jobs have all dried up
And I still have not wisened up
So I'll take out more loans and take more classes
Until I've paid enough for them to call me Master
And when the bill comes due I'll jet
And I'll fly away

I'll settle down in this one-horse town
Where the captains of philosophy gather
And learn all there is to know about this tree
And in this one-tree town
I'll meet my fellow tree scholars
And we'll go out drinking and singing and dancing
And we'll write songs about our lives of leaves
Until the day comes where we must fly away

I'll hop from town to town
From city to city
From brewery to pub
From house to studio apartment
Meet new folks
Make new friends
Fall in love all over again
But each contract has an expiration
And these dental fillings won't pay itself
So I'll destroy this life and start anew
And I'll fly away

I'll fly away
From Moscow to Lawrence
From Edinburgh to Gainesville
From Copenhagen to Reno
From Kinshasa to Ann Arbor
From Adelaide to Auburn
From Bogota to Baton Rouge
From Mexico City to Lexington
From Little Rock to Osaka
From Lima to Missoula
From Paris to Kenosha
From Fresno to Johannesburg
From Kumming to Athens
From Sao Paulo to Philadelphia
From Flatbush to Yonkers
I'll fly away

No pictures on these walls
No bedframe on this mattress
Not a single plot of land to my name
No use in any earthly possessions
They'll only weigh me down when I know
I'll fly away

But why don't you fly away with me?
Leave your job with me
Leave your scene with me
Leave your home with me
Leave your friends with me
Leave your family with me
Leave your favorite pizza spot with me
Leave your life with me
And fly away?

Please fly away with me
But you can't
You're a kiwi
Best you can do is an economy ticket on the Amtrak
How can I ask you to fly away with me?

My friends and family never see me
My clan is scattered all across the globe
They ask me how I live like this
I tell them that one day I'll settle down
When I'm buried deep in the ground
And the roots seep deep into my bones
But until that day comes
I'll fly away
