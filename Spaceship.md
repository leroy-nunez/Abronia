# Spaceship

I am going to build a spaceship<br />
I will gather the aluminum alloys<br />
The graphite epoxy motors<br />
To build the rockets to hurl me off this rock<br />
I will steal the kerosene and liquid oxygen<br />
To fuel these jet engines<br />
I do not care about pollution<br />
This rock is gone for me anyhow<br />
These rockets, like Artemis' Bow,<br />
will slingshot me into the void<br />
I will pass the Moon and Mars<br />
The storm of asteroids, the girth of Jupiter,<br />
the rings of Saturn, the frost of Pluto<br />
I will jump the Kuiper Belt through the Oort Cloud<br />
into the vastness of the interstellar void<br />
I will pass galaxies, nebulae, white dwarves, quasars, and black holes<br />
Until, I find a star much like our own<br />
I will visit every star until I find one with a rock much like our own<br />
Same size, same distance, same oxygen<br />
I will land on every rock until I find one<br />
with the slime oozing out of the water<br />
and from that slime, over time,<br />
spark of nerves, heart pumping blood, lungs taking in air,<br />
bones, muscle, limbs, skin,<br />
eyes, teeth, lips, hair, a face.<br />
There is much of this world that I do not know.<br />
I do not know engineering<br />
I do not know astronomy<br />
I do not know biology<br />
All that I know is that YOU ARE NOT HERE<br />
And that I will build a spaceship<br />
And visit every galaxy,<br />
every star,<br />
every rock,<br />
until I find one with another you.
