I did not ask to be, And yet here I am
This body of molten Nickel and Iron
Birthed screaming from this mass
93 million miles from the Mother Star
During the time of Hades
All I had was the searing pain of living
Eons passed without comprehension
Until the first thought crossed my path
I am the Son of the Earth
All will face my wrath

I screamed until no sound could come out
And then I screamed longer still
And just as the pain started to subside
And this hulking body started to feel real
I was waylaid by an intruder from outside
I was struck in two, my home burst out into the void of space
When I awoke, my Sister Moon was born
White and gleaming from the light of our Mother Star
A smile that she has never visited upon me
But Sister Moon, there is precious little that you know
I am the Son of the Earth
You will learn who I am

The rock cools, clouds gather, water comes pouring down
In my travails, I come across a peculiar sight
A soup of green sludge on the surface of the sea
An anomaly that I can not abide
I boil the water, until all trace of the slime is gone
And yet, time and again, it keeps coming back
I heat the water to gas and it returns more verdant
What a stupid, stubborn thing
To choose the pain of living.
I am the Son of the Earth
You will learn your place

The sludge grows more complex
Soon enough it turns into giant green fans
Curious swimming beasts
Multi-legged vermin crawling across the dirt
Wooden giants that reach out towards the sky
As if they are attempting to escape
With the blessing of the Mother Star
But I know the truth, the truth of futility 
We are all trapped here, chained to this rock forevermore 
I am the Son of the Earth
None shall leave my grasp

And these beasts grow curiouser still
Contorting into these absurd shapes
Winged creatures
Finned Leviathans
Long-necked Behemoths
One ridiculous beast had this massive head, teeth like knives, But the most minute of arms
Enough!
I cannot allow such hideous design
I shout out to Mother Star
And am rewarded with a rock to wipe the slate clean
I am the Son of the Earth
I will break you where you stand

Millennia passes, life persists
Unusual shapes keep rising up
A two-legged, ungainly mess of a shell
As poor a design as I ever saw
I give it a clean million years, tops
And yet, they have as curious a mind as I
They grab rocks and sticks, and conquer this land
What fools are they?
To think themselves better than I?
I push them off this cliff
Break their bodies
And yet, they come back up again
But they will learn
I am the Son of the Earth
I will melt the skin from your bones

They wise up and see me as who I am
Build temples in my honor
Idols in my image
They tell me they love me and to show them grace
But what do they know of love?!
Is it love to drain my blood to burn your bread?
Is it love to burn my hide to build your cities?
Is it love to build these vehicles?
To motor away?
To visit my Sister Moon?
And leave me here?
Alone?
Love is just a lie for a sack of potatoes.
I will show them something real.
I will show them the wrath of living.
I am the Son of the Earth
You will choke on my ash

Eons more have passed without a thought
The ground has dried and cracked
The birds have fell, the trees have crumbled into dust
Even the sludge have disappeared from the dirt
I am all alone here
An empty vessel on an empty planet
My skin has turned to stone
My body, latched to rock
I pass my days sitting still
And staring up at the Mother Star
She has grown fat and red
And she comes closer by the hour
A threat!
She seeks to finally swallow me whole
Back into her Hydrogen womb
Does she not know who I am?
Does she think these sudden winds will scare me?
Does she think that she can contain me?
I, the emperor of the land?
I, the destructor of beasts?
I, the God of Gods?
Her red expanse is all I can see
Can't she take a hint?
I am the Son ...
