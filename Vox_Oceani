I found myself upon the precipice,
between the terra firma of my known world,
and the silhouette of the unknown,
flowing in and out,
cleaning the sand between my toes.
Phantom Stars shower over my head.
False starships flutter between them.
While the Red Moon places her hex upon me.
She beckons me to lay amongst the sandy pebbles,
atop the glowing microscopic extraterrestrials,
that flitter away once they are seen,
as if they were a magic trick.
And I lay down,
until my silhouette,
merges with the silhouette of the night.

But from across the sea,
a pellet knocks me down.
It was the Ocean's voice.
It sounded like you.
A fragment of your voice,
singing our favorite song.
It envelops me like cashmere sheets.
It had been so long,
But I could never forget,
your voice was always there.
Before they landed on Rapa Nui,
Before the Moon burst from the Earth,
Before the first stars exploded into a trillion worlds.
And I dive in,
towards the endless horizon,
until my voice reaches yours.
