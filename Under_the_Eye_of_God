All of this is true.
He told me that he was gonna be gone next week.
He told me that I should be on my best behavior.
He told me that I need to keep the work up.
Don't slack off.
Don't dilly-dally.
He told me that he would know If I did.
That he will be watching me the whole time.
Reviewing the footage,
Minute by minute,
Second by second.
He told me that there was a camera hidden in the room.
That there was no escape.

This all feels true.
They want to know what music I'm listening to.
They want to know what shows I'm watching.
They want to know who I'm talking to.
Who is she? 
Where is she from? 
Why is she leaning on you like that?
No locks on these doors.
No doors on these rooms.
I turn around from the computer.
I hear: "Is that from Japan?"
"We can't trust you with this."
"We only want to protect you."
"Don't you know my son?"
"Don't you know that Satan is all around you?"
There is a camera in Pikachu's eye.
I could not escape.

Let's go out birdwatching.
Let's make a list.
Travel to all the places that we convinced ourselves didn't exist.
See all the Bobolinks, Kingfishers, Barred Owls, and Scrub-Jays.
Let's fly down to Florida,
See the flamingos in Biscayne Bay.
But haven't you heard the news?
None of this is real.
They slaughtered all the birds.
They hallowed out the mountains,
And filled them with their drone-chruning sweatshops.
But no one wants to know the truth.
That there is a camera in the flamingo's eye.
That there is no escape.

Where are you right now?
You've been moving around a lot.
You've been buying a lot of plane tickets.
Is there anything you want?
I know you want binoculars.
I know you like mystery novels.
I know you listen to movie podcasts.
I know you don't want to be alone.
I know you.
But are you even real?
Are you someone that I made up?
Do you have a life on the other side of the screen?
I guess it doesn't matter.
I will figure you out.
There is a camera in your Apple iPhone 14 Pro.
You can not escape.

I know this is true.
I know that you are watching me from the other side.
I know that you see me in my home.
In my kitchen,
In my bathroom,
Sleeping in my bed.
Maybe I don't have to lie to you.
Maybe you will see the real me.
Not the doppelganger that prances in front of the world.
You see how my shoulders slump in the kitchen.
You see how I stare out into the void in the shower.
You see how I toss and turn at night.
And jolt awake at 3 AM.
Only to find myself alone in a dark room.
Maybe we can understand each other.
That there is a camera overlooking our bed.
Do we even want to escape?

So let's go.
We make our daring escape.
We go off the grid.
Out into the wild scrub of Arizona.
Beneath a clear night sky.
Nothing but the truth of the stars and galaxies above. 
Under the Eye of God.
But those aren't stars up there...
We will never escape.
Well,
Time to give 'em a show.
