# Dusty Cabinets

When I die do not bury me<br />
Do not burn, quarter, or crucify me<br />
Take my skin, my heart, lungs, and liver<br />
Pump them with formal, stretch them to leather<br />
Take my eyes and put them in jars<br />
Take my brain and put it behind bars<br />
Put my bones in immaculately labelled boxes<br />
Along with the bears, whales, and foxes<br />
Then, one day, millions of years from now<br />
An outside visitor will come upon these dusty cabinets<br />
They'll open the box where my swollen clavicle resides<br />
And they will know what a human being really is
