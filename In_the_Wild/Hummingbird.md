# Hummingbird

I am in Florida,<br />
Hillsborough is the County,<br />
Tampa the City.<br />
I am a junior at King High.<br />
I ask Phoebe to the Homecoming Dance,<br />
and she has a panic attack.<br />
We do not go to the dance.<br />
I am in Florida,<br />
Alachua is the County,<br />
Gainesville the Town.<br />
I ask Danielle if she would like to grab a slice at Satchel's.<br />
She does not have a panic attack.<br />
We have a lovely time.<br />
We wander towards Bo Diddly Plaza,<br />
where a Tom Petty cover band is playing.<br />
I hear them sing "Don't it feel like something from a dream?"<br />
<br />
I am in New York,<br />
New York is the County,<br />
Manhattan the Borough.<br />
I am in front of a live studio audience.<br />
I am being interviewed by a Yale-educated man in a perfectly tailored suit.<br />
He keeps asking me these invasive questions,<br />
questions that I do not know the answers to,<br />
but I do to others.<br />
So I look at him with deep black eyes and tell him,<br />
"I know what you did at Skull and Bones".<br />
He shuts up.<br />
<br />
I am on the Conamara Chaos<br />
Europa is the Moon,<br />
Jupiter the Planet.<br />
I traverse the icy skids on robotic appendages,<br />
four on each side, the front two armed with a pickaxe and shovel.<br />
I work on the water mines until my battery dies,<br />
and watch as they ship them in bottles,<br />
towards the Third Rock from the Sun.<br />
I have vague images of orchids long dead,<br />
filled with the sweet sugar water.<br />
<br />
I am in Switzerland,<br />
Geneva is the Canton,<br />
Geneva the City.<br />
I stand before the Large Hadron Collider<br />
I hop over railing and wander inside the cylinder,<br />
just as an escaped office hamster steps on the big, shiny, green button labelled "ON"<br />
In an instant my atoms are torn asunder,<br />
all trace of the form that the living world knew of me was gone.<br />
<br />
I am in Venezuela,<br />
Bolivar is the State,<br />
Amazon the Rainforest.<br />
I am a hummingbird.<br />
Crimson Topaz, Topaza pella.<br />
I flit around from flower to flower,<br />
gulping down the sweet sugar water from each seductive orchid.<br />
In the back of my mind, I hear someone sing,<br />
"Don't it feel like something from a dream?"<br />
<br />
I am in Manila,<br />
Luzon is the Island,<br />
The Philippines the Country.<br />
I suddenly awake in a crowded market square.<br />
The bustle soon translates to screams as folks scatter.<br />
I catch a glimpse in a mirror,<br />
and see two bulging eyes coming out of a barren skull,<br />
patches of muscle covering skeletal limbs.<br />
My lungs and heart tucked beneath my ribs.<br />
Then, just as suddenly, I disintegrate into the ether.<br />
<br />
I am at the Massachusettes Institute of Technology,<br />
Cambridge is the Town,<br />
Massachusettes is the State.<br />
I am a PhD student in Quantum Physics.<br />
Studying the nature of matter itself.<br />
The interconnectedness of atoms across the Universe,<br />
across dimensions.<br />
There is a lot of fancy math.<br />
I am awarded a Fullbright to work overseas.<br />
To the European Organization for Nucelar Research,<br />
in Geneva, Switzerland.<br />
<br />
I am on Kepler-296e,<br />
Kepler-296 is the Star,<br />
Under No Lawful or Earthly Jurisdiction.<br />
I am a regal Quezalitoga.<br />
My outer layer is made of stunning white and green feathers.<br />
I posses a perfectly oval face with a taut, parrot-like beak.<br />
I am an emissary from the Kingdom of Gondwana,<br />
with a message to the folks of Laurisa.<br />
But I took a wrong turn at the Crab Nebula,<br />
and now I'm uh stuck here.<br />
I fiddle with the radio to try to intercept a message.<br />
But I just hear the cracklings of a voice from long ago,<br />
from California by way of Florida,<br />
"Don't it feel like something from a dream?"<br />
<br />
I wake up in a blank, white room.<br />
Parts Unknown.<br />
A tall, dark woman walks in.<br />
She tells me that they have been trying to contain me for 567 years.<br />
That after the incident at Geneva, I have been reconstituting myself into different forms,<br />
across space and time.<br />
Everything that I once was or will be.<br />
But I don't remember any of this,<br />
just the taste of the sweet sugar water.<br />
She tells me that the media is waiting for me outside.<br />
They have so many questions.<br />
<br />
I am in my spaceship.<br />
Leaving Kepler-296e,<br />
back towards Laurisa.<br />
I pass the time sculpting these unusual winged, beaked creatures.<br />
I do not know what they are, but they pop up in the recesses of my mind.<br />
They provide me comfort.<br />
Suddenly a rift opens up.<br />
Someone has pressed the shiny, green "ON" button in a place far, far away.<br />
A long, long time ago.<br />
Everything hits at once.<br />
All of history, all of knowledge, all of whatever is the universal equivalent of humanity.<br />
It all comes to a random set of atoms.<br />
<br />
I am waking up in a valley in New Zealand,<br />
Murihiku is the District.<br />
Rakiura the Island.<br />
I am a Tukutuku gecko.<br />
Harlequin scales of blood red and gold.<br />
I no longer rememeber my name.<br />
But I remember that I was a hummingbird.<br />
How it felt like something from a dream.<br />
I rearrange my atoms,<br />
back into the Crimson Topaz,<br />
and I flit away.<br />
In search of the sweet sugar water.<br />
