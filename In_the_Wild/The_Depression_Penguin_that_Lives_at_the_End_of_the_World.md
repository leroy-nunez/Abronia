# The Depression Penguin that Lives at the End of the World

The Depression Penguin lives at the End of the World.<br />
His home coordinates are, as follows:<br />
75.149° S<br />
160.239° E<br />
Type that into Google Earth and what do you get?<br />
A boundless sheet of white.<br />
In street view, a couple of mountains in the distance.<br />
But really all you see is white,<br />
and a transition along the horizon,<br />
from white to a darker and darker blue,<br />
until you are covered by that single shade of blue,<br />
hexadecimal code 233760,<br />
in the cloudless sky,<br />
during the endless day.<br />
<br />
The Depression Penguin is depressed.<br />
He does not know why.<br />
Maybe he has deep-seated childhood trauma.<br />
Maybe he has the wrong mixture of chemicals in his brain.<br />
But he will not know.<br />
There are no therapists at the End of the World.<br />
There is no health insurance either.<br />
All he has is the horizon,<br />
and the blue above, and white below.<br />
<br />
The Depression Penguin has a name.<br />
Pavel Vladamir Zhoukovsky.<br />
Or Paul.<br />
He does not know why his name is of Russian origin.<br />
He has not been from one End of the World to the Other.<br />
He does not know that he has a name.<br />
That that is the name that would appear on his Birth Certificate.<br />
If they had printers at the End of the World.<br />
Which they do not.<br />
Just the glare of the endless sun.<br />
<br />
The Depression Penguin loves music.<br />
He loves jazz.<br />
He loves celestial jazz.<br />
Avant-garde, free, unstructured.<br />
Tenor Sax, Harp, Piano, Strings.<br />
He wants to Astral Walk into the Door to the Cosmos.<br />
But he does not know this.<br />
There are no record players at the End of the World.<br />
No cassettes, CDs, or MP3s.<br />
All he has is the transition from white to blue.<br />
<br />
The Depression Penguin is in love.<br />
He loves a shadow laid out on the white.<br />
Not the one that he sees now,<br />
one that used to stand beside that one.<br />
But that shadow saw the wrong end of a leopard seal.<br />
The shadow left behind can go back to the shore,<br />
find a new shadow.<br />
But he doesn't want to start from the beginning,<br />
he wants the shadow he used to have.<br />
<br />
The Depression Penguin wants to reach for the stars.<br />
He wants to fly out into the endless sky.<br />
Past gaint spheres of hydrogen.<br />
Past vast graveyards of stars.<br />
Past inescapable chasms of spacetime.<br />
Past colors unseen by his eyes,<br />
worlds unknown to him,<br />
unknown to anyone,<br />
except the shadows in the void.<br />
"But why?"<br />
Asks the Dour German Filmmaker. <br />
Such dreams are futile.<br />
He doesn't even know he has dreams.<br />
So the Depression Penguin waddles to the horizon,<br />
where the white turns to blue.
