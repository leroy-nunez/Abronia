# Vox Oceani

I found myself upon the precipice,<br />
between the terra firma of my known world,<br />
and the silhouette of the unknown,<br />
flowing in and out,<br />
cleaning the sand between my toes.<br />
Phantom Stars shower over my head.<br />
False starships flutter between them.<br />
While the Red Moon places her hex upon me.<br />
She beckons me to lay amongst the sandy pebbles,<br />
atop the glowing microscopic extraterrestrials,<br />
that flitter away once they are seen,<br />
as if they were a magic trick.<br />
And I lay down,<br />
until my silhouette,<br />
merges with the silhouette of the night.<br />
<br />
But from across the sea,<br />
a pellet knocks me down.<br />
It was the Ocean's voice.<br />
It sounded like you.<br />
A fragment of your voice,<br />
singing our favorite song.<br />
It envelops me like cashmere sheets.<br />
It had been so long,<br />
But I could never forget,<br />
your voice was always there.<br />
Before they landed on Rapa Nui,<br />
Before the Moon burst from the Earth,<br />
Before the first stars exploded into a trillion worlds.<br />
And I dive in,<br />
towards the endless horizon,<br />
until my voice reaches yours.
