# Wandering Albatross

Victor Valerio was abducted by aliens,<br />
as he was sleeping on a bench at Marcus Garvey Park.<br />
He was ensconsed in a subtle neon green glow,<br />
floated up to their starship.<br />
They gave him a hot shower,<br />
a clean shave and a Caesar cut.<br />
They clothed him in bespoke garments,<br />
made of linen, shimmering emerald to match his eyes.<br />
They placed him in a new pair of orthopedic sneakers,<br />
neon red to match his shock of hair.<br />
<br />
They fed him a full three course meal,<br />
Bruschetta appetizer made with fresh mozzarella,<br />
gnocchi with sausage, shrimp, shaved parmesan,<br />
served in a creamy vodka sauce,<br />
just as Mam√° used to make it, <br />
paired with a light pilsner brewed in Prague.<br />
and for dessert, a rich tiramisu,<br />
so soft you didn't know where the cream ends and the savoiardi begins.<br />
<br />
They then took him to a room,<br />
the room was a screen,<br />
a screen that showed him the minutes of his life,<br />
from St. Luke's Hospital,<br />
to a ground floor apartment in Alphabet City,<br />
to a playground where he broke Alex's nose,<br />
to a High School Prom where Alex broke his heart,<br />
to a Dorm at Fordham where he tried his first drop of acid,<br />
to a job at Duane Reade headquarters,<br />
to a mass layoff at Duane Reade headquarters,<br />
to a late unemployment application,<br />
to an eviction notice,<br />
to all the vagaries of life that would turn a park bench into a home.<br />
<br />
But he is with the aliens now.<br />
Where they will take him to fantastical worlds,<br />
the turbulent red storms of Jupiter,<br />
the calming yellow oceans of Titan,<br />
the Blue Flares of Betelgeuse,<br />
the pulsar winds of the Crab Nebula,<br />
to the end of the Universe,<br />
where he will see himself in another world,<br />
where he has a clean shave and a Caesar cut.<br />
And then he will go to sleep,<br />
in a Goldilocks mattress,<br />
and sheets of linen.<br />
<br />
Victor Valerio was not abducted by aliens.<br />
He never saw the pulsar winds of the Crab Nebula.<br />
He was taken into a wagon by the Boys in Blue.<br />
To an undisclosed location,<br />
simply for sleeping.<br />
He was just a man.<br />
A Wandering albatross whose signals got crossed.
