# Obituary for Max Machiavelli

Here lies Maximiliano Mariano Machiavelli,<br />
Who built the Petronas Towers,<br />
Who mined the La Brea Tar Pits,<br />
Who mowed the lawns of every house,<br />
of every cul-de-sac,<br />
of every exurb.<br />
Whose office sat in the highest floor,<br />
of the highest tower,<br />
of the highest mountain.<br />
Where he sold dreams,<br />
Where he sold cures,<br />
Where he sold truth,<br />
Where he sold lies,<br />
Where he sold gold,<br />
where he sold the power to sell.<br />
<br />
Here lies Maximiliano Mariano Machiavelli,<br />
Who convinced the world that Splenda will help you lose weight,<br />
that cocaine will make you beautiful,<br />
that burning trees is good for growing corn,<br />
that corn is good food for hungry cows,<br />
that farting cows are good for the weather,<br />
that cars will grant you freedom,<br />
that a studio apartment in Telluride,<br />
filled with furniture from IKEA,<br />
paid for by a job at Goldman Sachs,<br />
will give your life direction,<br />
will fill the empty slot in your soul.<br />
<br />
Here lies Maximiliano Mariano Machiavelli,<br />
Who elected presidents and anointed kings,<br />
Who staged coups and quashed rebellions,<br />
Who told the roads where they could go,<br />
Who told the trains how fast they could ride,<br />
Who told the ships when they could dock on the port,<br />
Who told the planes where they could fly,<br />
what they could carry,<br />
over what lands,<br />
over what villages,<br />
whether they could drop fire, pamphlets, or bread.<br />
<br />
Here lies Maximiliano Mariano Machiavelli,<br />
Who shot the last dodo bird,<br />
who plucked the feathers from it's skin,<br />
who seasoned it with Black pepper from a Manila galleon,<br />
who cooked it slow over burning charcoal,<br />
and ate it with a side of soup made with the last Aldabran tortoise,<br />
and a glass of rum,<br />
made from the sugar cane cut by the slaves on his Cuban plantation,<br />
over a leather rug made from the last Quagga,<br />
that he skinned himself,<br />
cause he is a working man,<br />
a man who is willing to get his hands dirty.<br />
<br />
Here lies Maximiliano Mariano Machiavelli,<br />
Who has a substack <br />
where he opines on societal ills,<br />
where he opines about the clothes the kids wear,<br />
where he opines that the food doesn't taste as good as it used to,<br />
that the news anchors aren't as pretty as they used to be,<br />
how no one can say what's on their mind anymore,<br />
how the thought police is out to get hard-working folks like him,<br />
instead of the filthy vagrants on the street,<br />
squatting on his freshly mowed lawns.<br />
<br />
Here lies Maximiliano Mariano Machiavelli, <br />
Who saved millions of lives,<br />
and slaughtered millions more.<br />
Who loved all of his sons and daughters,<br />
and all of their mothers.<br />
Who invented the cure for cancer,<br />
and brilliantly sold it at 300 times the market price.<br />
Who endured the slings and arrows of the peasantry,<br />
and let them crucify his soul.<br />
So they could live in a world,<br />
where their lungs will burn in the soft orange Venusian air.<br />
<br />
Here lies Maximiliano Mariano Machiavelli,<br />
Who lived to 135 years,<br />
After getting a heart from a marine,<br />
After getting a liver from a first grade teacher,<br />
After getting a pancreas from an ER nurse,<br />
After getting a heart from an Olympic diver,<br />
After getting a heart from a man on death row.<br />
Who died peacefully in bed in his beachfront estate overlooking the Ionian,<br />
surrounded by his sons and daughters,<br />
and some of their mothers.<br />
Who was confused and angry at the end,<br />
Who's final words were "I don't know. I just don't know."<br />
<br />
Here lies Maximiliano Mariano Machiavelli,<br />
Who was born in a cabin in Savoca,<br />
Who made the world hum,<br />
Who saved civilization,<br />
Who killed the Earth,<br />
Who ended in the same place as everyone else,<br />
where all are equal.
