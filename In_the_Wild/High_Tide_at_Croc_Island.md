# High Tide at Croc Island

It's High Tide again at Croc Island,<br />
Where the sun blisters your eyes,<br />
and the air drowns your skin.<br />
Where the flies feast on your blood,<br />
and the vultures patrol the streets.<br />
Where the cottonmouths ride the surf,<br />
and the cranes host tailgates on your lawn.<br />
Where the land seeps into the sea like a sieve.<br />
<br />
An anole runs into my bedroom,<br />
flashes his blood red dewlap in my face.<br />
To remind me whose house this really is.<br />
The feral cats congregate beneath the foundation,<br />
where they engage in loveless lovemaking,<br />
the silent night punctured by their violent skreeks.<br />
In the morning, the kittens will conquer the roof,<br />
a newly minted island in a brackish sea.<br />
<br />
The lovebugs enter the scene.<br />
Conjoined from end to end in a mechanical embrace.<br />
They don't even notice the people walking down,<br />
the cars whizzing by the highway,<br />
the cold metal of the radiator,<br />
colliding at 75 miles per hour.<br />
Broken eggs in a lovebug omelette,<br />
frozen in time in a forever embrace.<br />
<br />
The cars race through the highway,<br />
12 lanes wide, not a turn in sight.<br />
The roadsides littered with flaking billboards,<br />
adorned with talking fetuses,<br />
blue-eyed, long-haired Messiahs,<br />
carnival-barking gators urging you to take exit 275,<br />
to dive into the flooded swamps of empty parking lots,<br />
of haunted strip malls and Walmart supercenters.<br />
<br />
A manatee swam into my living room.<br />
She was scarred from nose to tail,<br />
just like all the ones that came before.<br />
She started gnawing at my curtains,<br />
to get a taste of this new world she finds herself in.<br />
a new world littered with futons, beer bottles, and pizza boxes.<br />
And disgusting, inedible, beige curtains.<br />
But she faced all those motor boats in the past,<br />
and she'll face these new ones as they come.<br />
<br />
Walk into the clearing and there's a man,<br />
With skin like tree bark, eyes like glass.<br />
He lives in a house that burned down in '79,<br />
that was whisked into the sky in '86,<br />
that was swept away in '92,<br />
that was swept away in '08,<br />
in '19, in '21, '22,<br />
that was swept away last night.<br />
He's tired, but he picks up the soggy planks just the same.<br />
Croc Island is all he has known.<br />
All he will ever know.<br />
<br />
It's High tide again at Croc Island.<br />
Where the palmettos don't burn like they used to,<br />
where the pythons slither into your pickups,<br />
where they replace the swamps with cattle ranches,<br />
where they replace the cattle ranches with golf courses,<br />
where they replace the golf courses with ocean,<br />
where the soft glow of the Waffle House is an oasis,<br />
an oasis of black coffee and greasy hash browns,<br />
where you convalesce after the storm,<br />
and lash out against life's death roll.<br />
It's High Tide again at Croc Island,<br />
yet people still get by.<br />
