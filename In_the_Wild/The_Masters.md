# The Masters

Hamilton started to see the measure of the world.<br />
They beheld the Nubian Desert,<br />
Then the fine sand that made the desert,<br />
Then the Silicon and Oxygen atoms that make the sand,<br />
Then the protons and neutrons that make the atoms,<br />
Electrons, Fermions, Bosons,<br />
The fundamental being of matter, by any name.<br />
An idea was born.<br />
Then a shared synaptic pulse.<br />
<br />
Ada saw the mathematical formulas that could complete any task.<br />
Goddard saw how the stars in the night had died long ago. <br />
Theodosius saw the cauldrons that built the world at the bottom of the sea.<br />
Evita saw the strands and helices that structured life.<br />
Erasmus saw how the horses in the river begat the whales in the ocean.<br />
Wallis saw how the bees in the garden begat endless flowers in the forest.<br />
Duncan saw a spark from two colliding atoms.<br />
Wolfgang saw the levers of society that produced infinite wealth.<br />
Upon their mighty carapace, Hamilton gave them a home.<br />
<br />
Erasmus would dutifully follow Wallis across the uncharted territory,<br />
she would forget about him, until a swarm of aracaris descend upon him.<br />
Evita cycled through a rolodex of paramours,<br />
each time procuring a child with their hair and her vulpine eyes.<br />
Theodosius and Goddard were fellow sailors,<br />
determined to breach the horizons of experience.<br />
Ada and Duncan would fly together along the beach,<br />
discussing the world that could be, if only we'd get out of the way.<br />
Wolfgang kept himself isolated from the others,<br />
but surrounded by a procession of increasingly dour choirboys.<br />
Hamilton would just stare at grains of sand falling in an hourglass.<br />
<br />
Eurekas abound.<br />
Nothing was beyond them.<br />
Ada would calculate the formulas,<br />
that Duncan used to design the electrical circuits,<br />
that Goddard used to charge the rockets into the night,<br />
that Theodosius used to power the submersibles into the deep.<br />
Erasmus would declare that there exists a bird that fits perfectly into this flower,<br />
then he would find the bird and slot it perfectly into the flower.<br />
Huzzahs followed.<br />
But he would not notice,<br />
Wallis would already be at the Orinoco, sifting for catfish.<br />
<br />
Ada saw Hamilton standing on the beach,<br />
All the grains of sand had fallen to the bottom of the glass.<br />
Hamilton beheld her with those sorrowful eyes,<br />
just as they beheld the Nubian Desert,<br />
and stood there until the tide rolled in.<br />
<br />
They buried Hamilton on a cliff overlooking the Red Sea.<br />
The work went on.<br />
Goddard would orbit Mercury, Venus, and Mars,<br />
Theodosius mapped the rings of fire at the bottom of the Pacific,<br />
Ada wrote machines that mimicked her singularity,<br />
Duncan watched Mushroom clouds behind the glass,<br />
Wolfgang stripped Africa of Oil, Jade, and Diamonds,<br />
Evita measured the skulls of her children,<br />
Erasmus found less birds that fit into less flowers,<br />
Wallis beheld the Nanuuk Glaciers tumbling into the sea.<br />
<br />
Theodosius and Goddard grew weary of this rock, <br />
and sought to map the unknown currents beyond.<br />
Ada became overwhelmed at the infinite,<br />
and would cry herself to sleep in the morning.<br />
Evita had many a child fall to illness,<br />
she would dissect them as they stared back with vulpine eyes.<br />
Duncan would grow angry and bitter at the world,<br />
and retreat to his ship out in the Tasman.<br />
Wolfgang was the only one at peace with himself,<br />
surrounded by golden notes and bloodied bed sheets.<br />
Erasmus and Wallis crossed the Ganges in separate boats.<br />
<br />
In the final analysis, entropy always wins.<br />
Ada was found in a cove by the Laccadive, beak full of poppy seeds. <br />
Theodosius was plucked from the Marianas and drowned in the air.<br />
Goddard's face caved in when their space helmet cracked by Ganymede.<br />
Wolfgang was found with a cut throat and numerous small stab wounds.<br />
Evita was peacefully in bed, surrounded by her children.<br />
Erasmus was burnt to a crisp in a controlled slash and burn.<br />
Wallis walked off into the Atacama and was never seen again.<br />
<br />
Duncan is the only one left.<br />
Spending his days staring out into the Tasman.<br />
All he has are shattered memories,<br />
swirling like leaves in the wind.<br />
And a faded sepia-tone,<br />
of when they knew the world.
