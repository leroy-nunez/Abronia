# The Son of the Earth

I did not ask to be, And yet here I am<br />
This body of molten Nickel and Iron<br />
Birthed screaming from this mass<br />
93 million miles from the Mother Star<br />
During the time of Hades<br />
All I had was the searing pain of living<br />
Eons passed without comprehension<br />
Until the first thought crossed my path<br />
I am the Son of the Earth<br />
All will face my wrath<br />
<br />
I screamed until no sound could come out<br />
And then I screamed longer still<br />
And just as the pain started to subside<br />
And this hulking body started to feel real<br />
I was waylaid by an intruder from outside<br />
I was struck in two, my home burst out into the void of space<br />
When I awoke, my Sister Moon was born<br />
White and gleaming from the light of our Mother Star<br />
A smile that she has never visited upon me<br />
But Sister Moon, there is precious little that you know<br />
I am the Son of the Earth<br />
You will learn who I am<br />
<br />
The rock cools, clouds gather, water comes pouring down<br />
In my travails, I come across a peculiar sight<br />
A soup of green sludge on the surface of the sea<br />
An anomaly that I can not abide<br />
I boil the water, until all trace of the slime is gone<br />
And yet, time and again, it keeps coming back<br />
I heat the water to gas and it returns more verdant<br />
What a stupid, stubborn thing<br />
To choose the pain of living.<br />
I am the Son of the Earth<br />
You will learn your place<br />
<br />
The sludge grows more complex<br />
Soon enough it turns into giant green fans<br />
Curious swimming beasts<br />
Multi-legged vermin crawling across the dirt<br />
Wooden giants that reach out towards the sky<br />
As if they are attempting to escape<br />
With the blessing of the Mother Star<br />
But I know the truth, the truth of futility <br />
We are all trapped here, chained to this rock forevermore <br />
I am the Son of the Earth<br />
None shall leave my grasp<br />
<br />
And these beasts grow curiouser still<br />
Contorting into these absurd shapes<br />
Winged creatures<br />
Finned Leviathans<br />
Long-necked Behemoths<br />
One ridiculous beast had this massive head, teeth like knives, But the most minute of arms<br />
Enough!<br />
I cannot allow such hideous design<br />
I shout out to Mother Star<br />
And am rewarded with a rock to wipe the slate clean<br />
I am the Son of the Earth<br />
I will break you where you stand<br />
<br />
Millennia passes, life persists<br />
Unusual shapes keep rising up<br />
A two-legged, ungainly mess of a shell<br />
As poor a design as I ever saw<br />
I give it a clean million years, tops<br />
And yet, they have as curious a mind as I<br />
They grab rocks and sticks, and conquer this land<br />
What fools are they?<br />
To think themselves better than I?<br />
I push them off this cliff<br />
Break their bodies<br />
And yet, they come back up again<br />
But they will learn<br />
I am the Son of the Earth<br />
I will melt the skin from your bones<br />
<br />
They wise up and see me as who I am<br />
Build temples in my honor<br />
Idols in my image<br />
They tell me they love me and to show them grace<br />
But what do they know of love?!<br />
Is it love to drain my blood to burn your bread?<br />
Is it love to burn my hide to build your cities?<br />
Is it love to build these vehicles?<br />
To motor away?<br />
To visit my Sister Moon?<br />
And leave me here?<br />
Alone?<br />
Love is just a lie for a sack of potatoes.<br />
I will show them something real.<br />
I will show them the wrath of living.<br />
I am the Son of the Earth<br />
You will choke on my ash<br />
<br />
Eons more have passed without a thought<br />
The ground has dried and cracked<br />
The birds have fell, the trees have crumbled into dust<br />
Even the sludge have disappeared from the dirt<br />
I am all alone here<br />
An empty vessel on an empty planet<br />
My skin has turned to stone<br />
My body, latched to rock<br />
I pass my days sitting still<br />
And staring up at the Mother Star<br />
She has grown fat and red<br />
And she comes closer by the hour<br />
A threat!<br />
She seeks to finally swallow me whole<br />
Back into her Hydrogen womb<br />
Does she not know who I am?<br />
Does she think these sudden winds will scare me?<br />
Does she think that she can contain me?<br />
I, the emperor of the land?<br />
I, the destructor of beasts?<br />
I, the God of Gods?<br />
Her red expanse is all I can see<br />
Can't she take a hint?<br />
I am the Son ...
