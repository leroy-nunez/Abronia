# I'll Fly Away

This nest has grown too small for me<br />
This town has grown too simple to me<br />
And I have grown old enough to start this life<br />
So while Ma and Pa say goodbye in tears<br />
I'll spread my wings aloft<br />
And I'll fly away<br />
<br />
I'll live in this box with fellow goblins<br />
Subsisting on pizza, vodka, and adderall<br />
Reading Popper, Nietzche, and Pearson<br />
And after four years of debauchery<br />
They'll give me this paper that says Bachelor's of Science<br />
That will get me this here job<br />
And I'll fly away<br />
<br />
Now all the jobs have all dried up<br />
And I still have not wisened up<br />
So I'll take out more loans and take more classes<br />
Until I've paid enough for them to call me Master<br />
And when the bill comes due I'll jet<br />
And I'll fly away<br />
<br />
I'll settle down in this one-horse town<br />
Where the captains of philosophy gather<br />
And learn all there is to know about this tree<br />
And in this one-tree town<br />
I'll meet my fellow tree scholars<br />
And we'll go out drinking and singing and dancing<br />
And we'll write songs about our lives of leaves<br />
Until the day comes where we must fly away<br />
<br />
I'll hop from town to town<br />
From city to city<br />
From brewery to pub<br />
From house to studio apartment<br />
Meet new folks<br />
Make new friends<br />
Fall in love all over again<br />
But each contract has an expiration<br />
And these dental fillings won't pay itself<br />
So I'll destroy this life and start anew<br />
And I'll fly away<br />
<br />
I'll fly away<br />
From Moscow to Lawrence<br />
From Edinburgh to Gainesville<br />
From Copenhagen to Reno<br />
From Kinshasa to Ann Arbor<br />
From Adelaide to Auburn<br />
From Bogota to Baton Rouge<br />
From Mexico City to Lexington<br />
From Little Rock to Osaka<br />
From Lima to Missoula<br />
From Paris to Kenosha<br />
From Fresno to Johannesburg<br />
From Kumming to Athens<br />
From Sao Paulo to Philadelphia<br />
From Flatbush to Yonkers<br />
I'll fly away<br />
<br />
No pictures on these walls<br />
No bedframe on this mattress<br />
Not a single plot of land to my name<br />
No use in any earthly possessions<br />
They'll only weigh me down when I know<br />
I'll fly away<br />
<br />
But why don't you fly away with me?<br />
Leave your job with me<br />
Leave your scene with me<br />
Leave your home with me<br />
Leave your friends with me<br />
Leave your family with me<br />
Leave your favorite pizza spot with me<br />
Leave your life with me<br />
And fly away?<br />
<br />
Please fly away with me<br />
But you can't<br />
You're a kiwi<br />
Best you can do is an economy ticket on the Amtrak<br />
How can I ask you to fly away with me?<br />
<br />
My friends and family never see me<br />
My clan is scattered all across the globe<br />
They ask me how I live like this<br />
I tell them that one day I'll settle down<br />
When I'm buried deep in the ground<br />
And the roots seep deep into my bones<br />
But until that day comes<br />
I'll fly away
