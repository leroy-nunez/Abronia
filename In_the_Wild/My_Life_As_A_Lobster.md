# My Life As a Lobster

When I was a lobster, my carapace was immaculate<br />
My claws were powerful, my swimmerets the envy of all<br />
I was the King of Labrador, had the love and respect of my pod<br />
I lived out my days in those frigid waters<br />
And when I would grow big and awkward,<br />
I would molt this suit,<br />
And become a lobster reborn, brand new<br />
But now I find myself in this monkey suit, dumpy and clumsy<br />
Bad back, weak knees, blurry eyes, limp wrists<br />
And I pine back to my life as a lobster,<br />
The warrior of Labrador,<br />
King of the continental shelf<br />
<br />
When I was a coyote we ran these dusty streets<br />
We would pick off any lambs that dare cross our path<br />
My cunning was the legend of Sonora, feared by every jackrabbit in sight<br />
Visitors would come to me with starry eyes, <br />
And I speak their name, and speak their meaning<br />
Until they vomit up their fantasy, back to reality<br />
The reality of this monkey suit, alone in this desert<br />
My ankles pinned by cactus spines,<br />
My chapped lips, covered in blood and vomit<br />
And I ask myself how I allowed myself to get this far<br />
And I wish for my life as a coyote,<br />
The rogue of Sonora,<br />
Knight of the mesquite<br />
<br />
When I was an osprey, I could fish like no other<br />
I could catch pike, bowfin, tuna, just with these bare talons<br />
I ruled from my roost overseeing Boca del Rio<br />
I was the handsomest bird west of the Mississipp<br />
I never struggled for another's affection<br />
They built idols in my image,<br />
And sang songs of my exploits<br />
Songs that I can not sing,<br />
Not with this tongue that I have been given<br />
A tongue that can not find the words<br />
To say what is on my mind, to tell you how I feel<br />
And I yearn for my life as an osprey,<br />
The casanova of Boca,<br />
Lord of the lagoon<br />
<br />
When I was a viper, time moved more slowly<br />
I would just sit hidden from sight<br />
All I had to do was strike when it was right<br />
With nothing but my meal's heat to guide me<br />
And when I got hefty or inelegant,<br />
I would just slough off this skin<br />
And come out confident and pristine.<br />
But in this life, I'm stuck in this monkey suit<br />
This monkey suit that feels tight in all the wrong places<br />
This monkey suit that hurts where it touches the edges of the world<br />
This monkey suit that can't even walk right<br />
That can't even talk right<br />
That can't even say the words<br />
That let you see the real me<br />
So you can see the fire that fuels this automaton<br />
This monkey suit<br />
<br />
But I have never let you see me<br />
See me as who I am<br />
As a coyote yipping at the moon<br />
As an osprey soaring cross the lagoon<br />
As a viper in the grass, hidden from view<br />
Take me back to my life as a lobster,<br />
So I can shed this shell and be born anew
