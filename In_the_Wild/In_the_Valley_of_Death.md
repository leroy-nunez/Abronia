# In the Valley of Death

Smoke spews from the mountains.<br />
The sky turns black.<br />
The sky turns red.<br />
The ground melts beneath our feet.<br />
The air turns to fire.<br />
The water turns to acid.<br />
The methane seeps into our lungs.<br />
Bodies float up to the surface.<br />
Bodies crash down to the ground.<br />
But as I scuttle through the garden of bones,<br />
a sapling grows from the ashes before my eyes.<br />
From the Valley of Death, I will rise.<br />
<br />
The sky above plummets atop us.<br />
The air turns to ice.<br />
The water turns to soap.<br />
Giants fall all around me.<br />
Plants burst into flames.<br />
The ground suffocates,<br />
across a grey, new world.<br />
But from the carnage, opportunity arises.<br />
I set my sights up above.<br />
From my underground bunker,<br />
I reach for the sky.<br />
From the Valley of Death, I will fly.<br />
<br />
Vomit spews from my mouth.<br />
Rum comes in one end.<br />
Rum comes out the other end.<br />
Rum numbs the pain,<br />
as new faces swirl around me.<br />
But try as I might, I can not forget,<br />
The empty depression next to me on the bed.<br />
So I wander around this hurricane,<br />
Searching for fellow ghosts, <br />
to help me carry the strain.<br />
And I repeat this refrain.<br />
In the Valley of Death, I will love again.<br />
<br />
Horns blare from the streets.<br />
Drums thunder down the avenue,<br />
marching along a syncopated beat.<br />
Coffins parade through the thoroughfare,<br />
strangers join the procession,<br />
singing a song they have never heard,<br />
a song that has always existed,<br />
since before our gills turned to ears,<br />
before our fins turned to feet.<br />
Before the body in the box<br />
heard the song, entranced.<br />
In the Valley of Death, we will dance.<br />
<br />
Muscles atrophy along my limbs.<br />
Bedsheets burn through my skin.<br />
Air wheezes through shrunken lungs.<br />
Blood races through clogged veins.<br />
One by one, the machinery breaks down.<br />
I fall asleep with mushrooms in my eyes.<br />
I wake up with egg yolk on my tongue.<br />
The sand flows through my flippers,<br />
the light of the moon guides me<br />
to my treacherous ocean home.<br />
Where my life, I will give.<br />
In the Valley of Death, I will live.
