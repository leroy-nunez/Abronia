# Under the Eye of God

All of this is true.<br />
He told me that he was gonna be gone next week.<br />
He told me that I should be on my best behavior.<br />
He told me that I need to keep the work up.<br />
Don't slack off.<br />
Don't dilly-dally.<br />
He told me that he would know If I did.<br />
That he will be watching me the whole time.<br />
Reviewing the footage,<br />
Minute by minute,<br />
Second by second.<br />
He told me that there was a camera hidden in the room.<br />
That there was no escape.<br />
<br />
This all feels true.<br />
They want to know what music I'm listening to.<br />
They want to know what shows I'm watching.<br />
They want to know who I'm talking to.<br />
Who is she? <br />
Where is she from? <br />
Why is she leaning on you like that?<br />
No locks on these doors.<br />
No doors on these rooms.<br />
I turn around from the computer.<br />
I hear: "Is that from Japan?"<br />
"We can't trust you with this."<br />
"We only want to protect you."<br />
"Don't you know my son?"<br />
"Don't you know that Satan is all around you?"<br />
There is a camera in Pikachu's eye.<br />
I could not escape.<br />
<br />
Let's go out birdwatching.<br />
Let's make a list.<br />
Travel to all the places that we convinced ourselves didn't exist.<br />
See all the Bobolinks, Kingfishers, Barred Owls, and Scrub-Jays.<br />
Let's fly down to Florida,<br />
See the flamingos in Biscayne Bay.<br />
But haven't you heard the news?<br />
None of this is real.<br />
They slaughtered all the birds.<br />
They hallowed out the mountains,<br />
And filled them with their drone-chruning sweatshops.<br />
But no one wants to know the truth.<br />
That there is a camera in the flamingo's eye.<br />
That there is no escape.<br />
<br />
Where are you right now?<br />
You've been moving around a lot.<br />
You've been buying a lot of plane tickets.<br />
Is there anything you want?<br />
I know you want binoculars.<br />
I know you like mystery novels.<br />
I know you listen to movie podcasts.<br />
I know you don't want to be alone.<br />
I know you.<br />
But are you even real?<br />
Are you someone that I made up?<br />
Do you have a life on the other side of the screen?<br />
I guess it doesn't matter.<br />
I will figure you out.<br />
There is a camera in your Apple iPhone 14 Pro.<br />
You can not escape.<br />
<br />
I know this is true.<br />
I know that you are watching me from the other side.<br />
I know that you see me in my home.<br />
In my kitchen,<br />
In my bathroom,<br />
Sleeping in my bed.<br />
Maybe I don't have to lie to you.<br />
Maybe you will see the real me.<br />
Not the doppelganger that prances in front of the world.<br />
You see how my shoulders slump in the kitchen.<br />
You see how I stare out into the void in the shower.<br />
You see how I toss and turn at night.<br />
And jolt awake at 3 AM.<br />
Only to find myself alone in a dark room.<br />
Maybe we can understand each other.<br />
That there is a camera overlooking our bed.<br />
Do we even want to escape?<br />
<br />
So let's go.<br />
We make our daring escape.<br />
We go off the grid.<br />
Out into the wild scrub of Arizona.<br />
Beneath a clear night sky.<br />
Nothing but the truth of the stars and galaxies above. <br />
Under the Eye of God.<br />
But those aren't stars up there...<br />
We will never escape.<br />
Well,<br />
Time to give 'em a show.
