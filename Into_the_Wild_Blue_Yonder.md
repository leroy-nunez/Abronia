# Into the Wild Blue Yonder

My sloop rests in Biscayne Bay<br />
Her given name is Thessalonike<br />
Gifted from mothers and fathers to their sons and daughters<br />
But today, I hoist sail<br />
And set course into the Wild Blue Yonder<br />
Across the endless ocean<br />
Where I venture to waters unknown<br />
A sailor's life for me<br />
<br />
I see the albatrosses wandering in the distance<br />
They glide and dive effortlessly<br />
Til they crash land back to Earth, awkward and unsure<br />
Fumbling until the day they fly<br />
Back into the Wild Blue Yonder<br />
Across the Cerulean Sea<br />
Where no soul has ventured before<br />
An albatross' life for me<br />
<br />
Gonna surf the Tehuano Wind<br />
I ride from Campeche to Tuxtla<br />
From the swamps of Veracruz, to the shores of Oaxaca<br />
And with great gusts I will topple these semis<br />
Plunging them into the Wild Blue Yonder<br />
Into the boundless brine<br />
Give me the lift that I need<br />
A wind's life for me<br />
<br />
I have lived a million lifetimes before this one<br />
I was a mammoth trekking the plains of Siberia<br />
Bacteria seeping through the Precambrian slime<br />
Even a hundred fungal cells, outstretched beneath a Northwestern forest<br />
I was a Vulcanurukh hermit orbiting the Bynthos System<br />
Where I witnessed the death of Adama 9-D<br />
And I was enveloped in its superhot embrace<br />
My atoms had become one with the stars<br />
Drifting through space with fellow travelers<br />
Until they reconstitute with no memory of<br />
their time in the Wild Blue Yonder<br />
Across the infinite<br />
Where I have been, but do not know<br />
A star's life for me
