My sloop rests in Biscayne Bay
Her given name is Thessalonike
Gifted from mothers and fathers to their sons and daughters
But today, I hoist sail
And set course into the Wild Blue Yonder
Across the endless ocean
Where I venture to waters unknown
A sailor's life for me

I see the albatrosses wandering in the distance
They glide and dive effortlessly
Til they crash land back to Earth, awkward and unsure
Fumbling until the day they fly
Back into the Wild Blue Yonder
Across the Cerulean Sea
Where no soul has ventured before
An albatross' life for me

Gonna surf the Tehuano Wind
I ride from Campeche to Tuxtla
From the swamps of Veracruz, to the shores of Oaxaca
And with great gusts I will topple these semis
Plunging them into the Wild Blue Yonder
Into the boundless brine
Give me the lift that I need
A wind's life for me

I have lived a million lifetimes before this one
I was a mammoth trekking the plains of Siberia
Bacteria seeping through the Precambrian slime
Even a hundred fungal cells, outstretched beneath a Northwestern forest
I was a Vulcanurukh hermit orbiting the Bynthos System
Where I witnessed the death of Adama 9-D
And I was enveloped in its superhot embrace
My atoms had become one with the stars
Drifting through space with fellow travelers
Until they reconstitute with no memory of
their time in the Wild Blue Yonder
Across the infinite
Where I have been, but do not know
A star's life for me
