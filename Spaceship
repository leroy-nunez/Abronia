I am going to build a spaceship
I will gather the aluminum alloys
The graphite epoxy motors
To build the rockets to hurl me off this rock
I will steal the kerosene and liquid oxygen
To fuel these jet engines
I do not care about pollution
This rock is gone for me anyhow
These rockets, like Artemis' Bow,
will slingshot me into the void
I will pass the Moon and Mars
The storm of asteroids, the girth of Jupiter,
the rings of Saturn, the frost of Pluto
I will jump the Kuiper Belt through the Oort Cloud
into the vastness of the interstellar void
I will pass galaxies, nebulae, white dwarves, quasars, and black holes
Until, I find a star much like our own
I will visit every star until I find one with a rock much like our own
Same size, same distance, same oxygen
I will land on every rock until I find one
with the slime oozing out of the water
and from that slime, over time,
spark of nerves, heart pumping blood, lungs taking in air,
bones, muscle, limbs, skin,
eyes, teeth, lips, hair, a face.
There is much of this world that I do not know.
I do not know engineering
I do not know astronomy
I do not know biology
All that I know is that YOU ARE NOT HERE
And that I will build a spaceship
And visit every galaxy,
every star,
every rock,
until I find one with another you.
