When I was a lobster, my carapace was immaculate
My claws were powerful, my swimmerets the envy of all
I was the King of Labrador, had the love and respect of my pod
I lived out my days in those frigid waters
And when I would grow big and awkward,
I would molt this suit,
And become a lobster reborn, brand new
But now I find myself in this monkey suit, dumpy and clumsy
Bad back, weak knees, blurry eyes, limp wrists
And I pine back to my life as a lobster,
The warrior of Labrador,
King of the continental shelf

When I was a coyote we ran these dusty streets
We would pick off any lambs that dare cross our path
My cunning was the legend of Sonora, feared by every jackrabbit in sight
Visitors would come to me with starry eyes, 
And I speak their name, and speak their meaning
Until they vomit up their fantasy, back to reality
The reality of this monkey suit, alone in this desert
My ankles pinned by cactus spines,
My chapped lips, covered in blood and vomit
And I ask myself how I allowed myself to get this far
And I wish for my life as a coyote,
The rogue of Sonora,
Knight of the mesquite

When I was an osprey, I could fish like no other
I could catch pike, bowfin, tuna, just with these bare talons
I ruled from my roost overseeing Boca del Rio
I was the handsomest bird west of the Mississipp
I never struggled for another's affection
They built idols in my image,
And sang songs of my exploits
Songs that I can not sing,
Not with this tongue that I have been given
A tongue that can not find the words
To say what is on my mind, to tell you how I feel
And I yearn for my life as an osprey,
The casanova of Boca,
Lord of the lagoon

When I was a viper, time moved more slowly
I would just sit hidden from sight
All I had to do was strike when it was right
With nothing but my meal's heat to guide me
And when I got hefty or inelegant,
I would just slough off this skin
And come out confident and pristine.
But in this life, I'm stuck in this monkey suit
This monkey suit that feels tight in all the wrong places
This monkey suit that hurts where it touches the edges of the world
This monkey suit that can't even walk right
That can't even talk right
That can't even say the words
That let you see the real me
So you can see the fire that fuels this automaton
This monkey suit

But I have never let you see me
See me as who I am
As a coyote yipping at the moon
As an osprey soaring cross the lagoon
As a viper in the grass, hidden from view
Take me back to my life as a lobster,
So I can shed this shell and be born anew
